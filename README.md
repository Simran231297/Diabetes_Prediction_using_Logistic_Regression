Dataset Overview:
The "diabetes" dataset contains medical history features such as Glucose level, Blood Pressure, BMI, etc., along with a target variable indicating whether the patient has diabetes (1) or not (0).

Interpretation of model coefficients:
Among the features considered, Glucose has the highest impact on the likelihood of diabetes, with a correlation coefficient of 0.492908, which means that as the Glucose level increases, there is a stronger tendency for an individual to have diabetes.
Blood Pressure has the lowest impact on the likelihood of diabetes, with a correlation coefficient of 0.162986, which means that there is a weaker association between Blood Pressure and the likelihood of diabetes compared to other features in the dataset.

Model Performance Evaluation:
•	Oversampling significantly improves precision, recall, and F1 score, indicating better model performance in identifying patients with diabetes.
•	While cross-validation with oversampling using SGD provides insights into model performance across multiple folds, the average accuracy and precision are slightly lower compared to the scenarios without oversampling and with oversampling.
•	Overall, oversampling appears to be an effective technique for improving the logistic regression model's performance in predicting the likelihood of patients having diabetes. 
•	The logistic regression model with oversampling stands out as the best-performing model, offering superior precision, recall, and F1 score compared to other approaches. Further fine-tuning and validation on unseen data may be necessary to confirm the model's effectiveness in real-world scenarios.
